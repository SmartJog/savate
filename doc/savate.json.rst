JSON configuration file for savate
==================================

:Manual section: 5


Description
-----------

The configuration for **savate**\(8) is stored as a JSON (<http://json.org/>) dictionary.

The dictionary is divided in several configuration sections:

* the top or global section, containing server-wide variables.
* the `mounts` section, containing the list of streams, relays etc. for this **savate** instance.
* the `statistics` section, containing the configuration for logging handlers.
* the `auth` section, containing the configuration for authentication/authorisation handlers.
* the `status` section, containing the configuration for **savate**\'s status handlers.


A note on handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**savate** uses runtime-pluggable handlers for a number of tasks,
notably logging, statistics, authentication/authorisation, and status
pages. These handlers are usually Python classes or functions
implementing one of the corresponding handler API.


Options list
------------

Here follows the list of regular configuration options for
**savate**. Various pluggable handlers, notably the `auth` ones, can
add options in some sections, notably the `mounts` one.

Some options can be specified several times in different sections,
with the one in the deepest section overriding the others. For
example, you can specify a server-wide `burst_size` in the global
configuration, and then use another for a specific mount point. The
sections where an option can appear are specified after the
description, in parentheses.


`bind`  The IP address to bind to (global)

`port`  The IP port to bind to (global)

`log_file`      The path to savate's log file (global)

`pid_file`      The path to savate's PID file (global)

`net_resolve_all`       Boolean. Whether to fully resolve DNS entries to
multiple IPs when relaying an URL. This means savate will try to relay
the specified with each IP obtained. (global, `mounts`)

`burst_size`    The burst buffer size, in bytes. This represents the
amount of data to send to a client at connection time, to quickly fill
the player's playout buffer, making for a quicker startup on the
client side. (global, `mounts`)

`on_demand`     Boolean. When relaying an URL, only start pulling it when
a client connects to the mount point. (global, `mounts`)

`keepalive`     When using on-demand relaying, this represents the amount
of time, in seconds, that savate will keep pulling the URL once there
are no more clients using it. (global, `mounts`)

`clients_limit` The maximum number of streaming clients allowed. Over
this limit, savate will send a 503 HTTP response to a new client. Note
that this is only used for streaming clients; sources and status pages
clients are not affected by this limit. (global)

`max_queue_size` The maximum queue size for client buffers in bytes. If a
client isn't downloading data fast enough, the client will be disconnected when
that size is reached. Default is 24MB. (global, `mounts`)
